Notes: I tried to do this on my local Arch install, but the Makefile didn't 
    really like the Arch install of SFML, so I eventually came back here and
    have figured out why c9vnc did not work for me.

I got debuging help (mostly just what am I missing here?) from the Warfield 
    twins, my own twin, Jensen Krone, and probably some other people too.
    Also, CPW office hours were uite helpful.

for CPW debugging time: The program is picking the wrong minimum value for the
    path length.  And as such, it's drawing the wrong path asthe most 
    efficient, though it's close.
